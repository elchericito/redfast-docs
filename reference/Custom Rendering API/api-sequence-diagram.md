The following diagram illustrates how you would fetch data from the Ping API to receive eligible prompts and render it onto a screen. Once an eligible prompt is shown to a user additional endpoints should be called to facilitate the user’s interaction. Finally, the Ping API should be called again to refresh the prompts for which a user is eligible.
